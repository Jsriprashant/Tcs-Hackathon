# Supernova Motors – Environmental Sustainability Policy

Supernova manufactures electric and hybrid vehicles, builds ADAS systems, and operates mobility platforms. Our environmental footprint spans battery materials, semiconductor sourcing, energy usage, supply‑chain logistics, and cloud‑computing workloads for autonomy training.

## 1. Understanding Our Impact
Key impact domains:
- Battery cell sourcing & chemical processing  
- Rare‑earth motor component supply chains  
- Autonomous‑driving compute clusters  
- Manufacturing plant energy usage  
- Vehicle testing emissions from hybrid prototypes  
- Cloud storage for mobility fleets  

We maintain lifecycle assessments (LCA) for major vehicle platforms.

## 2. Reducing Our Impact

### Energy
- Renewable electricity for all U.S. facilities by 2028  
- High‑efficiency motors and regenerative testing rigs  
- Consolidated GPU clusters to reduce redundant ADAS training cycles  

### Water
- Closed‑loop coolant‑water recycling  
- High‑efficiency fixtures at manufacturing sites  

### Waste
- 90% recycling target for battery‑production scrap  
- Partnerships with certified lithium‑ion recyclers  
- E‑waste recycling for compute hardware  

### Supply Chain
- Vendor audits for environmental compliance  
- Preference for cobalt‑reduced or cobalt‑free chemistries  
- Low‑carbon logistics partners  

## 3. Community Initiatives
We sponsor EV‑literacy programs, energy‑efficiency advocacy groups, and municipal fleet‑electrification pilots.

## 4. Continuous Improvement
Annual reporting published each Q4.
