Rate And Terms of Payment

Rate. In consideration of Techno Box’s performance of the Services, Client shall pay to Techno Box professional services fees at the hourly (prorated for partial hours rounded to the nearest quarter hour) rate (the “Fees”) of $150 per hour per person. Techno Box will charge to Client $300 per hour for any time spent following up on unpaid, overdue invoices.
Payment Terms. At Techno Box we use weekly invoices as a quick turn-around of an accounting of hours. Sending an accounting of hours every week, and having that kind of visibility and approval, gives us assurance that we're heading in a direction that our clients feel good about. As such, Client shall pay to Techno Box the Fees as follows:

a) The initial deposit of $10,000 (the “Deposit”) shall be due and payable upon the execution of this Engagement Agreement to be applied against the final Fees that accrue during the course of Techno Box’s performance of the Services. The Deposit will be reflected in the final invoice(s) for this Engagement, such that no payment will be due to Techno Box by Client for the final $10,000 worth of work. Techno Box shall deliver to Client an invoice reflecting the Deposit upon the execution of this Engagement Agreement.
b) On a weekly basis thereafter, Techno Box shall deliver to Client an invoice reflecting the aggregate Fees accrued at the applicable rate(s) specified in Section 1 above during the preceding calendar week. Client shall pay invoices reflecting Fees accrued at the rate specified in Section 1 above on "Net 14 Days" terms. Invoices that are not paid within 14 calendar days will incur a 2.25% finance charge compounding every 14 day overdue period.
Techno Box will gladly offer estimates for additional specific deliverables upon request.
In Witness Whereof, the parties have executed this Engagement Letter.
