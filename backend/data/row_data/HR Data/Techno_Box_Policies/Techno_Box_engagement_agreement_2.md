Rate And Terms of Payment

Rate. In consideration of Techno Box’s performance of the Services, Client shall pay to Techno Box professional services fees at the hourly (prorated for partial hours rounded to the nearest quarter hour) rate (the “Fees”) of $120 per hour per person. In the case that Client does not meet the Payment Terms, below, Techno Box reserves the right to increase the Fees $200 per hour per person, as per Section 2e, below.
Payment Terms. At Techno Box we like to use a pay-forward arrangement as a valve for having work approved beforehand. We use weekly invoices as a quick turn-around of an accounting of hours and don't work further until more funds have been approved. Sending an accounting of hours every week, and having that kind of visibility and approval, gives us assurance that we're heading in a direction that our clients feel good about. As such, Client shall pay to Techno Box the Fees in advance as follows:

a) The initial installment for 50 hours of $6,000 (the “Advance Amount”) shall be due and payable upon the execution of this Engagement Agreement to be applied against the Fees that accrue during the course of Techno Box’s performance of the Services. Techno Box shall deliver to Client an invoice reflecting the Advance Amount upon the execution of this Engagement Agreement.
b) As Techno Box performs the Services and the Fees in connection therewith accrue at the rate(s) specified in Section 1 above, Techno Box shall apply the Advance Amount in satisfaction of the same. Techno Box shall deliver to Client an invoice reflecting a subsequent Advance Amount once the hours covered by the previously paid Advance Amount accrue to 50 hours or less.
c) On a weekly basis thereafter, Techno Box shall deliver to Client an invoice reflecting the Advance Amount less the aggregate Fees then accrued and applied against the Advance Amount as detailed therein during the preceding calendar week.
d) Client acknowledges and understands that Techno Box shall not be obligated to continue perform the Services in the event the Advance Amount has been fully applied to the Fees then-accrued and that Techno Box may cease performance of the Services until it receives payment of the Advance Amount in connection with a subsequent invoice.
e) Client acknowledges and understands that Techno Box reserves the right to increase the hourly rate to $200 per hour per person in the event the Advance Amount has been fully applied to the Fees then-accrued and until it receives payment of the Advance Amount in connection with a subsequent invoice.
f) In the event that upon the completion of the Services and final delivery of any work product related thereto the balance of the Advance Amount exceeds the aggregate Fees accrued in connection with the same, Techno Box shall refund to Client such balance within 15 days after Client’s acceptance of the Services and such work product in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Services Agreement.
Techno Box will gladly offer estimates for additional specific deliverables upon request.
In Witness Whereof, the parties have executed this Engagement Letter.
