Expectations for Contractors
The Techno Box family has always been comprised of independent self-starters who hold themselves to a high degree of excellence in their field and stand out as creatives and creative problem solvers. We aim to make Techno Box a home-away-from-home for our subcontractors and are always open to feedback as to how we can best organize our work flows and environment to facilitate productive relationships throughout our team.

Honesty, humor, kindness and respect for one another are key to the success of Techno Box and integral to being an Techno Box employee, member or contractor.
We extend to you an unlimited coffee tab at a local partner cafe, because caffeinated contractors are happy contractors. There are several other benefits described in this handbook Techno Box extends to our subcontractor family:

Professional financial advising
Chair massage for those tense shoulders of yours
Free lunch every Friday

In exchange for these benefits and the timely payment of all your invoices, we ask that you:

Produce excellent work product befitting a professional in your field.
Own the projects that you work on. At Techno Box there is a very thin management layer- that means that you will be relating directly with clients, and are expected to keep the health of the whole project in mind and fully own its success (and challenges).
Participate in established Techno Box processes; work to improve them if they need improvement. Some of these are status emails, collaboration tools, project management, standups, and version control. (see Communications & Ops for Contractors)
Always send a status email to status@Techno Box.com on every day that you are putting in time on a Techno Box project.
Standups (see Daily standup and Friday standup) are not mandatory but provide a nice cadence to the workday and are a helpful way of touching base with the rest of the Techno Box team. If you are remote, you can join via video call.
Always keep transparency of process and repeatability production as a rule of thumb. If you disappeared, your work should not disappear with you- i.e. make sure it is in project management & version control, not in email, unshared docs or any other non-transparent format.
Be available instantly when you are working (by smartphone, IM, and collaboration tools).
Try to make everyone’s job easier and more fun. Take things off of your coworker’s plates. Smile.
Be generous with your help.
Treat everyone who encounters Techno Box with respect and kindness.
