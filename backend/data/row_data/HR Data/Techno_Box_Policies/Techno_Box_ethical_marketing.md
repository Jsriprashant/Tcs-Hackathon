Purpose
Techno Box Ltd. considers environmentally intelligent practices to be an organizational priority. Simply because we are in the business of virtual production does not mean that our impact on the environment is only a virtual reality. We recognize that the manufacturing of computer equipment is currently a toxic and resource-heavy industry, and also that data centers are one of the biggest power users today.
According to Greenpeace’s most recent Click Clean Report (2017), “The energy footprint of the IT sector is already estimated to consume approximately 7% of global electricity. With an anticipated threefold increase in global internet traffic by 2020, the internet’s energy footprint is expected to rise further, fueled both by our individual consumption of data and by the spread of the digital age to more of the world’s population, from 3 billion to over 4 billion globally.”
Techno Box is committed to being aware of the extent of our environmental impact, and to mitigating it in every way possible, both through how we run our business and how we advocate for industry-wide eco-friendly changes.
Practice
So what can businesses like ours -- or any entity, be it a non-profit, a not-just-for-profit, or a household -- actually do to make a difference?

Know your impact.
Reduce your impact (and offset the rest).
Help others to do the same & champion each other’s efforts.

A Note on Home Offices
While Techno Box continues to maintain a physical office that is open to its members and the community, we recognize that more and more people are using their home offices. Techno Box encourages its members and community to take these principles home with them; all of these tools and practices can be applied to a home/family just as readily as an office.
On the energy side of things, we recommend programs like Energy Smart. The water, waste, and procurement resources listed in this policy can be applied at home.
1. Know Your Impact
Educate yourself about what impacts that each of your business activities has on our planet. Purchasing decisions. Travel and commuting. Data usage. Energy usage. Waste. Water.
Understanding Your Energy Consumption
If you are in the tech sector, or your website is a big part of your business operations -- heck, if you stream Netflix before bed at night -- you should be reading Greenpeace’s Click Clean reports (and participating in their consumer advocacy campaigns).
Whatever your business model, start by finding your own greenhouse gas emissions baseline. It’s not as easy as it sounds. There are scopes, there are offsets, there are renewable energy credits (RECs). But there are also great tools and resources to help you figure it out:

What are GHG emissions, and these Scopes you speak of?
What are RECs & Offsets and how are they different?
How do I calculate my organization’s emissions? (Hint: you can do it yourself, or hire a specialist.)
How much energy does my email take?

Understanding Your Water Consumption
This is a pretty tangible one -- after all you can see a leaky faucet or a hose left running in the garden bed -- but you might not be aware of just how much more efficient these new fangled low-flow toilets, high-efficiency dishwashers and in sink aerators can save. Many cities have programs designed to help you swap out inefficient older models.
Understanding Your Waste Production
Did you know that 90% of what goes into landfills is recyclable or compostable? Techno Box has an ambitious and comprehensive Zero Waste Strategic Plan with tons of resources to help your business (and your home) do its part.
Additional resources -- more than you ever wanted to know about what you can (and can’t) divert from the landfill -- are available through local recycling organizations.
2. Reduce Your Impact
Now that you understand the factors that contribute to your baseline, or current, impact on the environment through both your inputs (resources, energy, water) and your outputs (waste), you can set reduction targets and take steps to mitigate your impact in each area.
Reducing Energy Consumption
First, you need to reduce your actual energy usage through energy conservation measures (ECMs). This is something that Techno Box has done at our own offices, through switching to LED lighting with motion detectors, and more fuel efficient appliances.
Power Renewably
Once you’ve gone electric and replaced those old gas-burning (air-polluting) appliances, you can then switch to renewable power sources for those electric appliances. Options include installing solar directly or subscribing to renewable energy programs.
Reducing Water Consumption
Install low-flow fixtures and monitor usage monthly. Participate in local conservation programs.
Reducing Waste Production
Compost
Compost all organic waste, including food scraps and paper products.
Recycling
Recycle as much as possible; aim for 90% diversion rate.
Hard to Recycle Materials & Hazardous Waste Disposal
Properly dispose of electronics, batteries, and chemicals at designated facilities.
Landfill
Minimize landfill waste through audits and education.
3. Help others to do the same & champion each other’s efforts.
Everyone loves to be cool, so we have made a point of making earth friendly business practices super cool. You can start by influencing your own team; encouraging them to take best practices for the earth that you’re investing time and money in at the office, and bringing them home.
There is strength in numbers, so it really matters to join local movements and share resources, successes and goals.
Techno Box also shares resources by open sourcing our policies and by actively alerting other business owners in our community as to what we are doing to mitigate our environmental impact, and offering them resources to do the same.
4. #Grabyourwallet: Techno Box’s Procurement Priorities
One of the most powerful ways that we can exercise our principles in today’s world is with our dollar. This means both choosing vendors and suppliers that share our social and environmental values, as well as using our status as customers to pressure other businesses to improve their impact, when necessary.
We use the following criteria to select our suppliers and vendors:
Third Party Standards Verifications -- we prefer to purchase from certified sustainable businesses.
Local -- the benefits of supporting local businesses are numerous, both socially and environmentally.
Women and Minority Ownership -- We prioritize purchasing from women-owned and minority-owned businesses.
Shared Values -- Select providers with strong pro-environment stances.
Values-based product procurement in an ever-evolving market is complex, and there are many organizations out there who make it their business to know which products are the best for the earth, best for our communities, best for workers, etc.
