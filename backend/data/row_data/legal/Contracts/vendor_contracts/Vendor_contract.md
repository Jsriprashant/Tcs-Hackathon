# VENDOR SUPPLY AGREEMENT  

**Execution Date:** April 15, 2018  

This Vendor Supply Agreement (this “**Agreement**”) is entered into as of April 15, 2018 (the “**Effective Date**”), by and between **Baker Foods Corp.**, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 123 Industrial Way, Wilmington, DE 19801 (“**Buyer**”), and **Global Grain Suppliers, LLC**, a California limited liability company with its principal place of business at 456 Harvest Lane, Bakersfield, CA 93308 (“**Vendor**” or “**Supplier**”). Buyer and Vendor may be referred to herein individually as a “**Party**” and collectively as the “**Parties**.”  

## RECITALS  

WHEREAS, Vendor manufactures and supplies high-quality baking ingredients, including flour, yeast, and preservatives (the “**Products**”);  

WHEREAS, Buyer designs, markets, and sells processed baked goods and requires a reliable source of Products for its manufacturing operations;  

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to establish the terms under which Vendor will supply Products to Buyer on an ongoing basis;  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:  

## 1. DEFINITIONS  

1.1 **“Affiliate”** means, with respect to any entity, any other entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such entity.  

1.2 **“Confidential Information”** means any non-public information disclosed by one Party to the other, including but not limited to specifications, pricing, business plans, and intellectual property, whether oral, written, or electronic. Excludes information that is publicly known, independently developed, or required to be disclosed by law.  

1.3 **“Intellectual Property”** or “**IP”** means patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how, and any other proprietary rights.  

1.4 **“Products”** means the baking ingredients listed in **Exhibit A** attached hereto, including any modifications agreed upon in writing.  

1.5 **“Specifications”** means the quality, packaging, and performance standards for the Products as set forth in **Exhibit B**.  

1.6 **“Term”** has the meaning set forth in Section 3.1.  

1.7 **“Force Majeure Event”** means any event beyond a Party’s reasonable control, including acts of God, strikes, pandemics, or supply chain disruptions, but excluding financial inability to perform.  

## 2. SUPPLY AND PURCHASE  

2.1 **Supply Obligation.** During the Term, Vendor shall supply, and Buyer shall purchase, all of Buyer’s requirements for the Products, subject to Buyer’s forecast provided quarterly (the “**Forecast**”). Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet 100% of the Forecast, with priority given to Buyer’s orders over third-party commitments.  

2.2 **Purchase Orders.** Buyer shall issue purchase orders (“**POs**”) via electronic means, specifying quantities, delivery dates, and destinations. Vendor shall confirm acceptance within two (2) business days.  

2.3 **Delivery.** Products shall be delivered FOB Vendor’s facility, in accordance with the delivery schedule in the PO. Late deliveries exceeding five (5) days shall incur a 2% discount on the affected invoice.  

2.4 **Quality Assurance.** All Products shall conform to the Specifications and be free from defects. Vendor shall maintain ISO 22000 certification and provide certificates of analysis with each shipment.  

## 3. TERM AND TERMINATION  

3.1 **Term.** This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for an initial term of three (3) years (the “**Initial Term**”), automatically renewing for successive one (1) year periods unless either Party provides ninety (90) days’ written notice of non-renewal.  

3.2 **Termination for Convenience.** Buyer may terminate this Agreement or any PO for convenience upon one hundred eighty (180) days’ written notice. Vendor may terminate only for Buyer’s uncured material breach after thirty (30) days’ notice and opportunity to cure.  

3.3 **Termination for Cause.** Either Party may terminate immediately upon written notice if the other Party: (a) commits a material breach and fails to cure within thirty (30) days of notice; (b) becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy; or (c) violates Applicable Laws in performing under this Agreement.  

3.4 **Effects of Termination.** Upon termination: (a) all outstanding POs shall be completed unless canceled; (b) Vendor shall provide a “last-time buy” option for up to twelve (12) months of Buyer’s forecasted needs at then-current pricing; (c) Confidential Information shall be returned or destroyed; and (d) survival provisions (e.g., Sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) shall continue for their specified periods.  

**Red Flag Note:** Vendor-favorable termination—Buyer’s convenience right is limited to 180 days with last-time buy obligations, potentially locking in supply during integration and exposing to disruptions without surge capacity guarantees (cf. real SEC precedents like Sight Sciences Exhibit 10.10).  

## 4. PRICING AND PAYMENT  

4.1 **Pricing.** Prices for Products are set forth in **Exhibit A** and shall remain fixed for the first twelve (12) months. Thereafter, Vendor may propose annual adjustments not exceeding the lesser of 5% or CPI increase, subject to Buyer’s approval. Vendor shall pass through any raw material cost reductions within thirty (30) days.  

4.2 **Payment Terms.** Buyer shall pay undisputed invoices within net thirty (30) days of receipt, with 1% discount for payment within fifteen (15) days. All payments in USD via wire transfer.  

4.3 **Taxes.** Vendor shall be responsible for all taxes, duties, and fees arising from its performance, except those Buyer is required to withhold under Applicable Laws.  

## 5. WARRANTIES  

5.1 **Product Warranty.** Vendor warrants that, for a period of twelve (12) months from delivery: (a) Products conform to Specifications; (b) are free from defects in material and workmanship; (c) are not adulterated or misbranded under FDA regulations; and (d) do not infringe third-party IP (except as resulting from Buyer’s specifications).  

5.2 **Compliance Warranty.** Vendor warrants compliance with all Applicable Laws, including food safety (FSMA), labor, and environmental standards. Vendor is not on any U.S. government debarment lists.  

5.3 **Remedies.** If Products breach warranties, Buyer may, at its option: return for refund, require replacement at Vendor’s expense, or terminate the affected PO.  

## 6. INDEMNIFICATION  

6.1 **Vendor Indemnity.** Vendor shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates, officers, and customers from and against any Claims (as defined below) arising from: (a) Vendor’s breach of warranties; (b) personal injury or property damage caused by Products during manufacture or delivery; (c) Vendor’s violation of Applicable Laws; or (d) Vendor’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. “**Claims**” include losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and reasonable attorneys’ fees.  

6.2 **Buyer Indemnity.** Buyer shall indemnify Vendor similarly for Claims arising from Buyer’s negligence or willful misconduct.  

6.3 **Procedure.** The indemnified Party shall provide prompt notice of any Claim, cooperate in defense, and allow the indemnifying Party to control settlement (except where it admits liability or affects reputation).  

6.4 **Limitations.** Neither Party’s aggregate liability shall exceed the amounts paid under this Agreement in the twelve (12) months preceding the Claim. No Party shall be liable for indirect, consequential, or punitive damages, including lost profits.  

**Red Flag Note:** Indemnity gaps—limited to direct damages and gross negligence only; no specific coverage for third-party IP infringement (e.g., if Vendor’s preservatives infringe patents) or supply chain cyber risks, potentially exposing Buyer to unrecoverable claims in M&A integration (vs. broader protections in benchmarks like Peter’s Technology agreement).  

## 7. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  

7.1 **Ownership.** Buyer retains all rights in its Specifications and any Developed IP (IP conceived during performance under this Agreement). Vendor grants Buyer a perpetual, royalty-free license to use Vendor’s pre-existing IP solely as incorporated in Products.  

7.2 **No Reverse Engineering.** Vendor shall not reverse-engineer Products or disclose Buyer’s Confidential Information to third parties.  

7.3 **Infringement.** If Products infringe third-party IP, Vendor shall, at its expense: procure rights, modify Products, or replace them. If unable, Buyer may terminate.  

## 8. CONFIDENTIALITY  

8.1 **Obligations.** Each Party shall protect the other’s Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care as its own (but no less than reasonable care), using it solely for performing under this Agreement.  

8.2 **Term.** Confidentiality obligations survive for five (5) years post-Termination.  

8.3 **Exceptions.** Disclosures required by law, with prior notice to the disclosing Party.  

8.4 **Return.** Upon request, return or destroy all Confidential Information, certifying compliance.  

## 9. FORCE MAJEURE  

Neither Party shall be liable for delays caused by a Force Majeure Event, provided prompt notice is given and efforts to mitigate are made. If the event exceeds sixty (60) days, the affected Party may terminate the affected PO without liability.  

**Red Flag Note:** Broad Force Majeure (excludes financial issues but no backup supplier requirement), favoring Vendor in disruptions—e.g., no obligation for alternate sourcing, risking Buyer’s production halts during M&A transition.  

## 10. MISCELLANEOUS  

10.1 **Governing Law.** This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflicts principles. Disputes shall be resolved exclusively in the courts of Wilmington, DE.  

10.2 **Assignment.** Vendor may not assign this Agreement without Buyer’s consent; Buyer may assign to Affiliates or in connection with a merger/acquisition.  

10.3 **Entire Agreement.** This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding and supersedes all prior agreements. Amendments must be in writing.  

10.4 **Severability.** If any provision is held invalid, the remainder shall continue in effect.  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Agreement as of the Effective Date.
