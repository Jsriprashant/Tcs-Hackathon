# MASTER DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT  

**Execution Date:** March 31, 2017  

This Master Distribution Agreement (this “**Agreement**”) is entered into as of March 31, 2017 (the “**Effective Date**”), by and between **Sonoma Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 1254 Chestnut Street, Suite 787, San Francisco, CA 94109 (“**Vendor**” or “**Supplier**”), and **Microbide Pharmaceuticals, LLC**, a California limited liability company with its principal place of business at 2000 Powell Street, Suite 600, Emeryville, CA 94608 (“**Distributor**” or “**Buyer**”). Vendor and Distributor may be referred to herein individually as a “**Party**” and collectively as the “**Parties**.”  

## RECITALS  

WHEREAS, Vendor develops, manufactures, and owns proprietary antimicrobial products, including wound care gels and sprays (the “**Products**”);  

WHEREAS, Distributor has expertise in pharmaceutical distribution and resale to end-users such as hospitals and clinics;  

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to establish a master framework for Distributor’s exclusive resale of Products in the Territory (defined below), subject to purchase orders;  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:  

## 1. DEFINITIONS  

1.1 **“Affiliate”** means any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a Party.  

1.2 **“Confidential Information”** means proprietary data, including Product formulations, pricing, and sales strategies, disclosed in any form. Excludes public information or independently developed data.  

1.3 **“Intellectual Property Rights”** or “**IPR”** means patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and related rights worldwide.  

1.4 **“Products”** means the items listed in **Schedule A**, including any updates approved by Vendor.  

1.5 **“Territory”** means the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.  

1.6 **“Net Sales”** means gross revenue from resale of Products, less returns, discounts, and taxes.  

1.7 **“Force Majeure”** means events like natural disasters, wars, or regulatory shutdowns beyond a Party’s control, excluding payment obligations.  

## 2. APPOINTMENT AND EXCLUSIVITY  

2.1 **Appointment.** Vendor hereby appoints Distributor as its exclusive distributor for resale of Products in the Territory during the Term. Distributor accepts and agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to promote and sell Products.  

2.2 **Purchase Orders.** Distributor shall submit purchase orders (“**POs**”) for Products, which Vendor shall fill subject to availability. Minimum annual purchase commitment: $500,000 in Year 1, escalating 10% annually.  

2.3 **Resale Terms.** Distributor may resell Products to approved customers only, at prices no lower than Vendor’s recommended list price (less 40% distributor discount). Distributor shall handle all customer warranties.  

2.4 **Compliance.** Distributor shall comply with all Applicable Laws, including FDA regulations, and maintain resale records for Vendor’s audit (up to twice annually).  

## 3. TERM AND TERMINATION  

3.1 **Term.** The initial Term shall be five (5) years from the Effective Date, automatically renewing for two (2) year periods unless notice of non-renewal is given 180 days prior.  

3.2 **Termination for Convenience.** Vendor may terminate this Agreement for convenience upon sixty (60) days’ written notice at any time after Year 1. Distributor may terminate only after Year 3, upon one hundred twenty (120) days’ notice, and must purchase all remaining inventory at cost plus 15%.  

3.3 **Termination for Cause.** Either Party may terminate immediately if the other: (a) materially breaches and fails to cure within thirty (30) days of notice; (b) becomes bankrupt or insolvent; (c) engages in unethical conduct affecting the Products; or (d) violates IPR.  

3.4 **Effects of Termination.** Upon termination: (a) all exclusivity ends; (b) Distributor shall cease resale and return/destroy Confidential Information; (c) Vendor has no obligation for transition support; (d) Distributor buys back unsold inventory at net book value within 90 days; and (e) Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 survive.  

**Red Flag Note:** Termination clauses heavily favor Vendor—short 60-day convenience window for Supplier vs. Distributor’s 120 days and mandatory inventory buy-back at inflated rates; no transition assistance clause, potentially stranding Buyer in supply gaps during M&A integration (cf. real Sonoma/Microbide agreement, where distributor bears repurchase burdens).  

## 4. PRICING AND PAYMENT  

4.1 **Pricing Schedule.** As per **Schedule B**: e.g., Product #SP-101 Gel at $25/unit wholesale, subject to annual review not exceeding 3% increase. Volume discounts: 5% over 10,000 units/year.  

4.2 **Payment.** Net 45 days from invoice; late payments accrue 1.5% monthly interest. All in USD.  

4.3 **Adjustments.** Vendor may adjust prices for raw material cost increases >5%, with 30 days’ notice.  

## 5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  

5.1 **Vendor Warranties.** Products are free from defects for 18 months post-shipment, comply with cGMP, and do not infringe third-party IPR.  

5.2 **Distributor Warranties.** Distributor has authority to enter this Agreement, will not modify Products, and will maintain adequate insurance ($5M product liability).  

5.3 **Limitation.** EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED, ALL WARRANTIES ARE DISCLAIMED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR PURPOSE.  

## 6. INDEMNIFICATION  

6.1 **Mutual Indemnity.** Each Party indemnifies the other for Claims arising from its breach, negligence, or IPR infringement. Vendor covers Product defects; Distributor covers resale misrepresentations.  

6.2 **Procedure.** Indemnified Party notifies promptly; indemnifying Party controls defense but cannot settle without consent if it admits liability.  

6.3 **Caps.** Indemnity limited to Net Sales in preceding 12 months; excludes indirect damages.  

## 7. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  

7.1 **Ownership.** Vendor retains all IPR in Products and trademarks. Distributor receives limited, non-transferable license for resale promotion only.  

7.2 **Infringement Claims.** Vendor defends Distributor against third-party IPR suits related to Products; Distributor notifies Vendor immediately.  

7.3 **Improvements.** Any Distributor-developed improvements belong to Vendor, with royalty-free license back to Distributor.  

## 8. CONFIDENTIALITY  

8.1 **Protection.** Parties shall safeguard Confidential Information for five (5) years post-Term, using reasonable efforts.  

8.2 **Permitted Use.** Solely for resale and performance; no disclosure to competitors.  

8.3 **Remedies.** Injunctions available for breaches; no adequacy of damages presumed.  

## 9. MISCELLANEOUS  

9.1 **Governing Law.** Laws of California; venue in San Francisco County courts.  

9.2 **Assignment.** Vendor may assign freely; Distributor requires Vendor consent, except to Affiliates.  

9.3 **Entire Agreement.** Supersedes priors; amendments in writing signed by both.
