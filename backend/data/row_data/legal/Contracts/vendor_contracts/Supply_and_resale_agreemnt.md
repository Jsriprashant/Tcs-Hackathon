# VENDOR SUPPLY AND RESALE AGREEMENT  

**Execution Date:** April 15, 2018  

This Vendor Supply and Resale Agreement (this “**Agreement**”) is entered into as of April 15, 2018 (the “**Effective Date**”), by and between **Baker Foods Corp.**, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 123 Industrial Way, Wilmington, DE 19801 (“**Buyer**” or “**Reseller**”), and **Global Grain Suppliers, LLC**, a California limited liability company with its principal place of business at 456 Harvest Lane, Bakersfield, CA 93308 (“**Vendor**”). Buyer and Vendor may be referred to herein individually as a “**Party**” and collectively as the “**Parties**.”  

## RECITALS  

WHEREAS, Vendor supplies bulk baking ingredients for resale and processing;  

WHEREAS, Buyer requires Products for its baking operations and resale to downstream customers;  

WHEREAS, the Parties seek to define supply, resale rights, and related terms;  

NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:  

## 1. DEFINITIONS  

1.1 **“Products”** means items in **Exhibit A**, for Buyer’s use and resale.  

1.2 **“Resale Territory”** means North America.  

1.3 **“Confidential Information”** as defined in Section 8.  

1.4 **“IPR”** means intellectual property rights.  

1.5 **“Force Majeure Event”** excludes vendor payment defaults.  

## 2. SUPPLY AND RESALE  

2.1 **Supply.** Vendor supplies Products per Buyer’s POs; minimum order $5,000.  

2.2 **Resale Rights.** Buyer granted non-exclusive right to resell Products in Resale Territory, subject to Vendor’s branding guidelines.  

2.3 **Forecasting.** Quarterly forecasts required; Vendor commits to 95% fulfillment.  

2.4 **Quality.** Products per **Exhibit B**; Buyer may inspect facilities quarterly.  

## 3. TERM AND TERMINATION  

3.1 **Term.** Initial three (3) years, auto-renewing annually with 90 days’ notice.  

3.2 **Termination for Convenience.** Vendor: 60 days’ notice post-Year 1. Buyer: 120 days’ notice, with inventory repurchase at cost +10%.  

3.3 **Termination for Cause.** Immediate for insolvency or uncured breach (20 days for Vendor, 45 for Buyer).  

3.4 **Effects.** Vendor provides no transition inventory; Buyer destroys Vendor samples. Survival: Sections 5-9.  

**Red Flag Note:** Asymmetric termination—Vendor’s quick 60-day exit vs. Buyer’s longer notice and repurchase duty; lacks post-termination support, risking resale channel disruptions in mergers (inspired by 2018-style SEC supply deals with supplier leverage).  

## 4. PRICING AND PAYMENT  

4.1 **Prices:** **Exhibit A**; annual cap at 4% increase.  

4.2 **Terms:** Net 30; 2% discount if paid in 10 days.  

## 5. WARRANTIES  

5.1 **Vendor:** 12-month defect-free warranty; FDA compliant.  

5.2 **Buyer:** Will not adulterate Products for resale.  

5.3 **Disclaimer:** No implied warranties beyond express.  

## 6. INDEMNIFICATION  

6.1 **Vendor:** For Product defects/IP claims.  

6.2 **Buyer:** For resale mislabeling.  

6.3 **Limits:** Capped at 12-month payments; no consequentials.  

## 7. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  

7.1 **License:** Limited resale use of Vendor IPR.  

7.2 **Infringement:** Vendor defends core claims.  

## 8. CONFIDENTIALITY  

8.1 **Obligations:** 4-year survival; reasonable care.  

## 9. MISCELLANEOUS

9.2 **Assignment:** Buyer only with consent.
