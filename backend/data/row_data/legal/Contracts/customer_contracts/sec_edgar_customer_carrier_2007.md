# FORM OF CUSTOMER CARRIER AGREEMENT  
**Execution Date:** July 1, 2007  

This Form of Customer Carrier Agreement (this “**Agreement**”) is entered into as of July 1, 2007 (the “**Effective Date**”), by and between **Neutral Tandem, Inc.** (together with affiliates, “**Carrier**”), a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 1 South Wacker Drive, Suite 200, Chicago, IL 60606, and **Telecom Partners Corp.**, a Illinois corporation with its principal place of business at 123 Network Blvd., Chicago, IL 60601 (“**Customer**”). Carrier and Customer may be referred to herein individually as a “**Party**” and collectively as the “**Parties**.”  

## RECITALS  

WHEREAS, Carrier provides tandem transit and access services for voice traffic;  

WHEREAS, Customer requires such services for its network operations;  

NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:  

## 1. DEFINITIONS  

1.1 **“Services”** means transit and access routing as per attached Service Order.  

1.2 **“Confidential Information”** means traffic data and pricing.  

1.3 **“Tariff”** means Carrier’s filed rates with FCC.  

1.4 **“Force Majeure”** means acts of God or regulatory halts.  

## 2. PROVISION OF SERVICES  

2.1 **Scope.** Carrier provides Services per Tariff and this Agreement.  

2.2 **Compliance.** Subject to all laws, including FCC rules; no resale without Carrier consent.  

2.3 **Ordering.** Via Service Orders; acceptance within 5 days.  

## 3. FEES AND PAYMENT  

3.1 **Rates.** Per **Exhibit A**; billed monthly.  

3.2 **Terms.** Net 30; disconnect for non-payment after 10 days’ notice.  

## 4. TERM AND TERMINATION  

4.1 **Term.** Initial 12 months; auto-renew monthly unless 30 days’ notice.  

4.2 **Termination.** For cause (breach, law violation) without notice; Carrier may suspend for non-payment.  

4.3 **Effects.** Pay all accrued fees; no refunds.  

**Red Flag Note:** Resale restrictions—no sub-resale or distribution allowed without explicit consent, with immediate termination for violations; ties to tariffs create regulatory risks in M&A (cf. Neutral Tandem 2007 form, where non-compliance leads to swift disconnection).

5.1 **Mutual.** For breaches or negligence.  

5.2 **Limits.** No consequentials.  

## 6. MISCELLANEOUS  

6.1 **Law.** Illinois; FCC jurisdiction.
