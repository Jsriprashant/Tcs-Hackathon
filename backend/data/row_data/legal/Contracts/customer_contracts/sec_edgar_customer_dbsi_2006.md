# FORM CUSTOMER INVESTMENT AGREEMENT  
**Execution Date:** June 15, 2006  

This Form Customer Investment Agreement (this “**Agreement**”) is entered into as of June 15, 2006 (the “**Effective Date**”), by and between **DBSI Services, LLC**, a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business at 225 Broadway, Boise, ID 83702 (“**Provider**”), and **Investor Group Inc.**, a California corporation with its principal place of business at 101 Market St., San Francisco, CA 94105 (“**Customer**”). Provider and Customer may be referred to herein individually as a “**Party**” and collectively as the “**Parties**.”  

## RECITALS  

WHEREAS, Provider offers investment management and real estate syndication services;  

WHEREAS, Customer seeks access for portfolio diversification;  

NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:  

## 1. DEFINITIONS  

1.1 **“Services”** means advisory and transaction execution per **Exhibit A**.  

1.2 **“Confidential Information”** means investment strategies and client data.  

1.3 **“Force Majeure”** excludes market downturns.  

## 2. PROVISION OF SERVICES  

2.1 **Scope.** Non-exclusive access to syndication opportunities.  

2.2 **Restrictions.** No resale or syndication of interests without consent; for internal use only.  

2.3 **Performance.** Provider uses best efforts; no guarantees on returns.  

## 3. FEES AND PAYMENT  

3.1 **Fees.** 2% management + 20% performance; billed quarterly.  

3.2 **Terms.** Net 15.  

## 4. TERM AND TERMINATION  

4.1 **Term.** Initial 36 months; auto-renew annually.  

4.2 **Termination.** For cause after 30 days’ cure; fees survive.

**Red Flag Note:** No cap on SLAs—unlimited liability for downtime or reporting delays, exposing to high claims (e.g., lost investment opportunities); resale restrictions limit transferability in M&A, risking churn from inflexible terms (cf. UBS/DBSI-style futures agreements with joint/several liabilities).

6.1 **Provider.** For errors in advice.  

6.2 **Limits.** None specified for SLAs.
