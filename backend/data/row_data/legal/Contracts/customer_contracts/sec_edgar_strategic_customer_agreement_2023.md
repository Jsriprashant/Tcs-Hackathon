# STRATEGIC CUSTOMER SaaS AGREEMENT  

**Execution Date:** January 15, 2023  

This Strategic Customer SaaS Agreement (this “**Agreement**”) is entered into as of January 15, 2023 (the “**Effective Date**”), by and between **TechFlow Solutions, Inc.**, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 456 Innovation Drive, San Francisco, CA 94105 (“**Provider**”), and **Global Enterprises Ltd.**, a New York corporation with its principal place of business at 789 Broadway, New York, NY 10003 (“**Customer**”). Provider and Customer may be referred to herein individually as a “**Party**” and collectively as the “**Parties**.”  

## RECITALS  

WHEREAS, Provider offers a cloud-based SaaS platform for enterprise resource planning and CRM (the “**Services**”);  

WHEREAS, Customer desires to access the Services on a strategic, high-volume basis for its internal business operations;  

WHEREAS, the Parties intend to establish a long-term partnership with preferential pricing and support;  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:  

## 1. DEFINITIONS  

1.1 **“Affiliate”** means any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a Party.  

1.2 **“Confidential Information”** means non-public data, including pricing, user data, and platform specs, disclosed in any form. Excludes public or independently developed information.  

1.3 **“Services”** means the SaaS platform hosted by Provider, including updates and support as detailed in **Exhibit A**.  

1.4 **“Users”** means Customer’s employees or contractors authorized to access Services.  

1.5 **“Term”** has the meaning in Section 4.1.  

1.6 **“Force Majeure”** means events beyond control, like cyberattacks or outages, excluding payment obligations.  

## 2. PROVISION OF SERVICES  

2.1 **Access Grant.** Provider grants Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access Services during the Term for internal use by up to 500 Users.  

2.2 **Usage Limits.** Customer shall not exceed User limits or resell Services without consent. Provider monitors usage and may charge overages at 150% of base rates.  

2.3 **Support.** Standard support per **Exhibit B**; premium strategic support includes dedicated account manager.  

2.4 **Data Security.** Provider complies with SOC 2; Customer responsible for user access controls.  

## 3. FEES AND PAYMENT  

3.1 **Fees.** As per **Exhibit C**: $250,000 annual subscription, billed quarterly in advance. Strategic discount: 15% off list price.  

3.2 **Payment Terms.** Net 30 days; late fees at 1.5% monthly. Fees escalate 5% annually upon renewal.  

3.3 **Taxes.** Customer pays all applicable taxes.  

## 4. TERM AND TERMINATION  

4.1 **Term.** Initial Term: 24 months from Effective Date. This Agreement shall automatically renew for successive 12-month Renewal Terms unless Customer provides written notice of non-renewal at least 30 days prior to expiration.  

4.2 **Termination for Convenience.** Customer may terminate post-Initial Term with 90 days’ notice; no refunds for prepaid fees. Provider may terminate for convenience with 180 days’ notice.  

4.3 **Termination for Cause.** Immediate termination if material breach uncured within 30 days’ notice, or insolvency.  

4.4 **Effects of Termination.** Upon termination: (a) access ceases; (b) Customer pays all fees through end of Term; (c) Provider exports Customer Data within 30 days (fees apply); (d) Sections 1, 3, 5-9 survive.  

**Red Flag Note:** Auto-renewal trap—automatic yearly renewal with short 30-day notice window and no fee cap on escalations (5% annual hikes), potentially leading to cost overruns and churn risks in M&A integration (cf. salesforce.com MSA precedents where renewals lock in escalating commitments).  

## 5. SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT (SLA)  

5.1 **Uptime.** 99.5% monthly uptime, excluding maintenance. Credits: 5% of monthly fee for <99%, up to 100% for <95%.  

5.2 **Remedies.** Sole remedy for downtime is credits; no liability for indirect damages.  

## 6. INDEMNIFICATION  

6.1 **Provider Indemnity.** For third-party claims of IP infringement in Services.  

6.2 **Customer Indemnity.** For Customer Data or misuse.  

6.3 **Limits.** Capped at 12 months’ fees; excludes consequentials.  

## 7. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  

7.1 **Ownership.** Provider retains all rights in Services; Customer owns its Data.  

7.2 **License.** Limited access license; no reverse engineering.  

## 8. CONFIDENTIALITY  

8.1 **Obligations.** Protect for 5 years post-Term; standard exceptions apply.  

## 9. MISCELLANEOUS  

9.1 **Governing Law.** California; arbitration in San Francisco.
