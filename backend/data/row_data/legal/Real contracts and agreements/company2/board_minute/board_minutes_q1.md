# BOARD MEETING MINUTES – 08 Feb 2025
Present: All directors except independent director (quorum issue?)

Agenda:
1. Approved ₹8 Cr related-party loan to founder’s prop-tech startup @ 4% interest (market rate 12-14%)
2. Deferred GDPR fine reserve “until cash flow improves”

**Discrepancy Flag:** Related-party transaction without independent approval + hidden liability
