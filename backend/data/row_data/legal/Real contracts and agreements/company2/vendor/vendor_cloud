# BBD SOFTWARE COM LTD – CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE AGREEMENT
**Execution Date:** 12 March 2024  
**Parties:** BBD Software Com Ltd (“Customer”) & SkyCloud India Pvt Ltd (“Vendor”)

## Term
Initial 36 months; auto-renews for 12-month periods unless terminated with 15 days’ notice.

## Termination
Vendor may terminate for convenience with 15 days’ written notice. Customer must provide 90 days’ notice and pay 75% of remaining contract value as exit fee.

## Indemnity
Vendor indemnifies only for gross negligence; cap at ₹50 lakhs. No indemnity for data breaches, IP infringement, or third-party claims arising from AI models hosted on the platform.

## SLA & Credits
99.9% uptime. Service credits capped at 5% of monthly fee. No liability for indirect or consequential damages (including lost revenue from customer churn).

**Discrepancy Flags for LLM:**
- 15-day vendor termination vs 90-day customer + huge exit penalty → supplier leverage nightmare
- No IP / data-breach indemnity (SaaS killer in M&A)
- Consequential damages exclusion + tiny SLA cap
