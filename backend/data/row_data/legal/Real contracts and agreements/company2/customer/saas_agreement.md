# BBD SOFTWARE COM LTD – MASTER SAAS SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT (v4.2)
**Customer:** LargeBank Corp  
**Effective Date:** 01 Jan 2025

## Subscription Term
60 months firm commitment. Auto-renews for successive 24-month periods unless Customer gives notice 15 days before renewal.

## Pricing
₹85 lakhs per year. Annual increase = higher of 12% or CPI + 5%. No cap.

## SLA
99.7% availability. Service credits = 2 days’ prorated fees per incident (max 10 days per year). Unlimited liability for direct damages; no cap mentioned.

## Data Export on Termination
Customer data available for export for 7 days post-termination; ₹5 lakhs “data retrieval fee” applies.

**Discrepancy Flags for LLM:**
- 15-day renewal escape window + 12% uncapped escalations → classic auto-renewal trap
- Unlimited direct-damage liability (opposite of industry norm)
- Punitive data-retrieval fee → lock-in risk
