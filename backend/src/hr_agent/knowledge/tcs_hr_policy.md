- Complainant, respondent, and witnesses entitled to confidentiality
- Public disclosure or discussing grievance details considered breach of confidentiality; subject to disciplinary action

**Anti-Retaliation Protection:**
- TCS strictly prohibits any adverse action against employee filing grievance
- Retaliation includes: denial of benefits, adverse appraisal, denial of promotion, transfer to undesirable location/role, salary reduction
- Employee reporting retaliation protected under whistleblower policy
- Retaliation substantiated results in disciplinary action against retaliating party, potentially termination

**No Impact on Performance:** Grievance filing not reflected in performance appraisal; appraisals proceed independent of grievance status.

### 9.5 Documentation and Record Keeping

- All grievances registered in centralized grievance register (Ultimatix)
- File maintained for 5 years post-closure
- Employee access to grievance record and resolution documentation provided upon request
- Confidential storage with restricted access

### 9.6 External Escalation

If employee remains unsatisfied after exhausting internal process:

- **Labor Department:** File complaint with District Labor Commissioner (under Industrial Disputes Act or relevant state labor law)
- **National Commission for Women:** If grievance involves gender-based discrimination
- **Legal Recourse:** Employee may pursue civil litigation or labor court appeal
- **Internal Audit/Ombudsman:** If available, may request independent review

TCS encourages internal resolution; external escalation not penalized but may affect relationship continuation.
